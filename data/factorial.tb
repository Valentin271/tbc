REM Computes the factorial of a given number
REM
REM Once compiled, type `echo -n "5" | dump.elf`
REM Otherwise INPUT also captures `\n`
REM Also, INPUT only supports one digit, so 9 is the maximum
REM
REM Alternatively, use the commented LET to set higher numbers
REM Factorial grow very quickly and will quickly overflow a 64bits integer

REM LET a = 5
INPUT a
LET r = 1

GOTO 50
30 LET r = r * a
LET a = a - 1
50 IF a > 0 THEN GOTO 30

PRINT r
PRINT "\n"
